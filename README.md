# ServerlessAPI-on-AWS
Build a CRUD Serverless API with AWS Lambda, API Gateway and a DynamoDB from Scratch

# Set up AWS Account:
If you haven't already, sign up for an AWS account.

# Create a DynamoDB Table:

Go to the DynamoDB console.
Click "Create Table" and define your table schema. For example, you might create a table called "Items" with a primary key named "ID".
Note the table name and primary key for later use.
Create IAM Roles:

# You'll need IAM roles for Lambda to access DynamoDB.
Go to the IAM console.
Create a role with permissions to access DynamoDB and attach it to your Lambda function.
Write Lambda Functions:

# Create Lambda functions for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with DynamoDB.
For example, for the "create" operation, your Lambda function might take input from the API Gateway, format it, and then insert it into DynamoDB.
Set Up API Gateway:

# Go to the API Gateway console.
Create a new API.
Define resources and methods for each CRUD operation (e.g., POST for create, GET for read, PUT for update, DELETE for delete).
Integrate each method with the corresponding Lambda function.
Deploy API Gateway:

# Deploy your API to a stage (e.g., "prod").
Note the endpoint URL generated by API Gateway.
# Test Your API:

Use tools like Postman or cURL to test your API endpoints.
Send requests to create, read, update, and delete items in your DynamoDB table.
